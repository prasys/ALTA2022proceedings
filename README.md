features:
uses easy2acl code
there are some changes in the tex files to add footer, to add page numbers, you'll need to change the code so that the page number is passed to stampc file.


# Important info:
Assuming the plan is to host the proceedings in the ACL Anthology, this page contains the overall process:
https://aclanthology.org/info/contrib/

Notice the following bit:
"If you are a conference publications chair, you must register your intention to submit your proceedings. This step requires you to send (a) the complete list of volumes that will be published in the Anthology (main conference volumes and workshops) and (b) the desired publication date. This information should be assembled in a spreadsheet and then communicated to the Anthology Director in a single email. Please do this as early as possible, ideally well before the submission deadline."

If you are like me you probably did not contact the Anthology Director (I assume it is still Matt Post) yet... If you already did, then you're good. Otherwise, make sure you compile the initial spreadsheet and send it to him asap. Our communications went fine, it just that the ingestion into the Anthology ended up being delayed.

Last year, I had to submit a link to Matt with the proceedings following the ACLPUB format. Information about it can be found here:
https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/anthology.html
https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB

Most of the information there assumes you use Softconf. For EasyChair, there is a bit of an extra work to be done before it is in the required format. I used Andy's scripts, available here: https://bitbucket.org/andymackinlay/alta2019-proceedings/src/master/

This should cover everything. I recommend starting by 1) contacting Matt and 2) running Andy's scripts as above. I don't remember running into any major issues, just had to do some editing to the cover page to accommodate sponsor logos.
